Functions are a block of codes made up of set steps that results in a single specific action. Functions are important because they help your code insert a number of steps under one action, keep your code short, and save you programming time. Functions usually "take in" data, process it, and "return" a result. Once a function is written, it can be used over and over and over again. Functions allow us to reuse code instead of rewriting it, functions allow us to test small parts of our program in isolation from the rest, and they allow us to conceive of our program as a bunch of sub-steps. Functions are a set of instructions put together to achieve a specific outcome. Functions are great alternatives to having repeating blocks of code in program. Functions help avoid writing out codes over and over again.
