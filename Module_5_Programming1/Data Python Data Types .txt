There are five main data types used in Python; Numeric, Sequence Type, Boolean, Set, and Dictionary. Data types are the classification or categorization of data items. With Data Python, data types are classes and variables are objects of these classes. In Python, numeric data represent the data which has numeric value. In Python, sequence is the ordered collection of similar or different data types. Sequences allow for the storage of multiple values in an organized manner. There are several sequence types in Python. String, List, and Tuple are just a few to mention. In Python, Boolean are data types with one of the two built in values, true or false. In Python, unlike sequence type, Set is an unordered collection of data type that is capable of returning its members one at a time, permitting it to be iterated over in a for loop. A set also is mutable and has no duplicate elements. The order of elements in a set is undefined. Lastly, dictionary is also an unordered collection of data values utilized to store data values unlike other Data Types that hold only single value as an element. Dictionary holds key value pair.
